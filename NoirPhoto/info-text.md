Noir turns any photo into dramatic black and white, with a customizable vignette for re-lighting the shot. It’s a fun and easy way to create images that tell a story.
​
 - Everything you can do with Noir is at your fingertips in the control panel at the bottom of the screen.
 - Import a photo using the Load button.
 - Start with any of the six presets across the top of the control panel.
 - Reposition the vignette however you like. The vignette control fades away when you’re not adjusting it. Just tap the image to bring it back.
 - The three dials control exposure outside the vignette, exposure inside, and overall contrast.
 - Select the color tint that works best for your image.
 - Save or share the image using the Save button.
 - Pro tip: You can save a new preset by pressing and holding one of the six preset buttons.
